# BooksApp
Project which comes under Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program

# Project Overview

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

# Why this project?
I learned about the JSON and about how to get data from an api. I also learned how to parse that data and display it to a user. This project gives me the ability to practice those skills, which will be key in developing any app which makes use of a backend server, real time data, or interactions over the internet.

# What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

    1- Fetching data from an API
    2- Using an AsyncTask
    3- Parsing a JSON response
    4- Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.

# Requirements
To achieve this, I'll make use of the Google Books API. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format. An example query that we found useful was :

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=android&maxResults=10
